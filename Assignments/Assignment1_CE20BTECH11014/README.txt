Notes:
Each file can be compiled individually. 
All the implementation of the deque in part A have been copied and pasted below the main function in part B to avoid complication while compiling

files can be compiled as follows:
gcc PartA.c -o deque
gcc PartB.c -o maze

run the executable as
./deque
./maze
